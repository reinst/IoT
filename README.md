This is for me to post code I create/learned while working with IoT devices mostly ESP32.

1. How sensors work
2. Send sensor data to database
3. Rasp Pi - MQTT broker, subscriber, and publisher
4. basic android app
5. Cloud MQTT broker with IFTTT control
6. Apache Kafka
7. create a class for "main sensors"
